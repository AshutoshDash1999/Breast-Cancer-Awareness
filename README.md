## What I built
Breast cancer is the 2nd most fatal cancer which needs your attention.
I have made a website for spreading awareness of breast cancer using `HTML`, `CSS`, `Bootstrap` and `Javascript`.
The site is hosted using [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).

### Category Submission: 
The site is presented in [Spider Event](https://spider-istebits.web.app/) where it ranked 7th overall and 2nd on content-wise.

### Additional Info
I'm looking forward to collab with creative individuals who can contribute to making the design better and improve the UX and coding stuff. Also, it will be great if you can contribute to improving the README.md file.
